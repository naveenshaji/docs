## What is Tessact?

Tessact is an end-to-end, AI-powered video platform that **automates editing, content analysis, and distribution**. You upload footage once, and Tessact’s large-context video model immediately understands every scene, enabling lightning-fast search, frame-perfect edits, and data extraction—all inside one workspace.

<Info>
Tessact follows a **Create → Collaborate → Deliver** lifecycle, so your team never leaves the platform from first ingest to final publish.

1. **Ingest**  
   Upload files or point Tessact at a cloud bucket/watch folder.  
2. **AI Analysis**  
   The platform indexes scenes, detects faces, extracts text, and generates metadata.  
3. **Search & Edit**  
   Use natural-language search to locate clips, then issue prompt-based edits or manual timeline adjustments.  
4. **Review & Collaborate**  
   Invite teammates or clients for real-time feedback, approvals, and AI-generated summaries.  
5. **Deliver**  
   Export in preset formats or publish directly to social platforms via integrated connectors.

<Tip>
Add custom automations—such as “auto-generate a 30 s highlight reel when a new game video lands in the bucket”—using Tessact’s REST API and Webhooks.

## Deployment & Licensing Options

Tessact is available in three deployment models:

| Model | Description | When to choose |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **SaaS (default)** | Fully-managed, multi-tenant cloud; latest features without maintenance. | Most teams—fastest time to value. |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Media files stay in your object store (S3/GCS/Azure). Compute runs in Tessact Cloud. | When egress costs or data residency matter. |
| **On-Prem** | Tessact nodes run inside your data centre or private cloud. | Broadcast or government environments with strict compliance. |

Licensing is subscription-based, metered by **seats + monthly render minutes**. Custom enterprise agreements include SLA guarantees, dedicated support, and volume pricing.

<Warning>
On-prem deployments require GPU nodes that meet Tessact’s hardware reference (NVIDIA A10 or higher).
</Warning>
