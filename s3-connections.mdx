title: "AWS S3 Connections"
description: "Connect an AWS S3 bucket to Tessact, then mount 1:1, two-way synced folders in the Library."
---

**S3 Connections** let Tessact work directly on the objects that already live in your own S3 bucket. Instead of copying files into Tessact storage, the platform simply links to a bucket and performs reads/writes on demand.

### Why connect S3?

- **Single source of truth** — Your media remains in S3; Tessact never makes a second copy.  
- **Instant availability** — Existing libraries become browsable in minutes with zero-copy ingestion.  
- **Two-way sync** — Upload, rename, or delete in either system, and the change appears in the other within minutes.  
- **Enterprise-grade security** — All access happens through the temporary, least-privilege AWS credentials you supply.

After you create a **Connection** in **Settings → Connections**, you can mount one or more **Connected Folders** in the Library. Each folder maps 1-for-1 to a selected path within the bucket and stays in continuous sync.

<Info>
A **Connection** stores credentials and connectivity settings (account, region, encryption).  
A **Connected Folder** mounts the entire bucket into a Library location with two-way sync.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS account** with access to the target S3 bucket  
- **IAM User** access keys scoped to the bucket  
- **Bucket Region** (e.g., `ap-south-1`)  
- **Least-privilege policy** as shown below – Tessact only needs list/read/write on the bucket, not full `s3:*` access  
- Optional: **S3 Object Lock/Versioning** for safer deletes, **SSE-KMS** if you encrypt with a CMK

<Tip>
Generate **dedicated access keys** for a single-purpose IAM user and rotate them regularly (≤90 days) for best security.
</Tip>

## Create a New S3 Connection

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Connections">
  Navigate to **Settings → Connections → New Connection → Amazon S3**.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose authentication method">
  Select **Access Keys**.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter core settings">
  - **Display Name** — Human-readable label  
  - **Region** — Exact AWS region (e.g., `ap-south-1`)  
  - **Bucket** — Name only (no `s3://` prefix)  

</Step>

<Step title="Save">
  Click **Create Connection** to save the connection.  
  <Check>Connection status shows **Active**.</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication

Tessact currently authenticates to S3 **only** through an IAM user’s access keys.

### Why use an IAM user?

- Universally supported—no cross-account role required  
- Quick to configure in any AWS account  
- Enforces least-privilege when you attach a restrictive policy

<Warning>
Long-lived keys can be compromised.  
• Rotate keys every 90 days (or sooner).  
• Store the secret only in Tessact’s encrypted vault.  
• Remove unused keys immediately.
</Warning>

### Setup steps

1. In the AWS console open **IAM → Users → Add user**.  
2. Tick **Programmatic access**.  
3. Attach the **permissions-policy.json** below.  
4. Finish the wizard and copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** into Tessact.

### Least-privilege S3 policy

```json permissions-policy.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "BucketList",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket"]
      
    },
    {
      "Sid": "ObjectRW",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
        "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
      ],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

That’s it—Tessact will now read and write objects only within the bucket.

## Create a Connected Folder

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Library → New → Connected Folder">
  From the Library toolbar, select **New → Connected Folder**.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Connection & path">
  - Choose an **S3 Connection**  
  - Pick **Path** to mount as a Connected Folder
  - Enter a **Folder Name** for Tessact to display in the Library
</Step>

<Step title="Review and create">
  Confirm the 1 : 1 mapping and two-way sync.  
  <Check>Connected Folder appears with an S3 badge; contents index shortly.</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Sync Semantics

| Operation in Tessact   | Effect in S3                | Notes                        |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Upload                 | PutObject at bucket  | Multipart for large files    |
| Rename/Move            | Copy → delete old key       | S3 has no atomic rename      |
| Delete                 | DeleteObject                | Use Versioning for recovery  |
| New object in S3       | Appears in Library          | Detected within minutes      |

<Warning>
Deletes propagate to S3. Enable **Bucket Versioning** or test in a non-production bucket before enabling two-way sync on critical data.
</Warning>

---

## Performance & Scaling

- Multipart uploads optimise files > 100 MB  
- Parallel listing accelerates first-time indexing  
- Back-pressure prevents S3 API throttling during high churn  
- API activity (LIST, GET, PUT, DELETE) incurs normal S3 request and data-transfer charges  

<Tip>
Keep key depth predictable (e.g., `project/YYYY/MM/DD/shot`) for faster listings.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="AccessDenied or 403">
Verify the IAM user policy includes **ListBucket** and **Get/Put/DeleteObject**. Check bucket **Region**.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="KMS access denied">
Ensure the IAM user has `kms:Decrypt`, `kms:Encrypt`, and related actions on the CMK.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Objects not appearing">
Wait for the next sync cycle; verify that new objects appear in the Library.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Slow listings or throttling">
S3 can throttle large numbers of consecutive **ListObjectsV2** calls. Tessact automatically backs off and retries, but you can improve performance by:  
- Using deeper, date-based prefixes (e.g., `project/YYYY/MM/DD/`)  
- Splitting very large buckets into several Connected Folders
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Check>
Your S3 bucket is now connected, and a two-way-synced folder is live in the Library. Upload, edit, and manage assets with full parity between Tessact and S3.
