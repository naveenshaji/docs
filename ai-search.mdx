title: "AI Search for Clips"
description: "Instantly surface 1–3-minute, context-aware clips from any video using Tessact’s multimodal, LLM-powered search."
---

## Overview

**AI Search for Clips** lets you type a natural-language prompt and receive ready-to-edit clips—normally between **1 and 3 minutes**—that match the *meaning* of your query, even when no exact words appear on-screen or in the transcript. The engine fuses computer vision, audio analysis, OCR, and a fast large-language model (LLM) that understands entire story arcs, so it can infer implied scenes (e.g., “hero triumphs” or “tense negotiation”) that traditional metadata alone would miss.

## How the Engine Builds Clips

1. **Signal extraction** – Tessact’s proprietary AI agent deeply analyzes every aspect of your video, capturing all relevant signals for the most accurate understanding of its content.  
2. **Semantic parsing** – A domain-tuned LLM ingests the entire video timeline, builds a context graph, and aligns scenes with your prompt, including implied meaning (e.g., “reveal,” “celebration,” “problem statement”).  
3. **Clip carving** – Tessact auto-selects a start and end that form a coherent narrative unit (≈ 1–3 min) with clean audio and video cut-points.  
4. **Ranking & deduplication** – Clips score on relevance, freshness, and diversity before display.

<Info>
**Quick Search** handles metadata-centric look-ups (custom fields, codecs, file names). **AI Search for Clips** focuses on semantic scene discovery.
