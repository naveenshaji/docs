## Before you begin
Tessact is currently invite-only. You can request a demo from the [contact page](https://tessact.ai/contact).

- **Invitation email** — You must receive a Tessact invite from our team before you can sign up.
- **Your assets** — You can upload any media file to Tessact. However for best performance, we recommend H.264/AAC `.mp4` under 12 Mb/s. For more information see [supported media formats](media-formats).

<Warning>
  The invitation link on the email expires after 24 hours for added security. If it lapses, use Login with OTP on the [login](https://app.tessact.ai/login) page instead.
</Warning>

    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for analysing to finish">
    Tessact uploads and queues the file for AI analysis. A progress pill appears on the asset card showing the progress of the analysis.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Average analysis speed is **≈ 15 minutes per hour of H.264/AAC content under
  10 Mb/s**. [Non-preferred codecs](/media-formats) or higher bitrates trigger transcoding and
  extend processing time.
</Note>

## 4. Trigger AI actions

Once your asset is analysed, you can trigger AI actions on it. 

<Tip>
  You can upload as many files as you want to the Library and trigger AI actions on them all. 
</Tip>

### Remix (create social clips)

Once analysing is finished, you can see the Remix bar at the bottom of the screen. Hovering on the suggestions will show you more suggestions for clips you can create with AI, or allow you to write your own prompt.

<Frame caption="Remix dialog with suggested and custom prompts">
  ![remix.jpg](/images/remix.jpg)
</Frame>

1. Hover over the remix suggestions on the **remix bar** at the bottom of the screen.
2. Pick a suggested prompt from the list or write your own (e.g., “Generate a 15-sec teaser”).
3. Tessact generates multiple aspect-ratio variants ready for download or review.

### AI Search for clips

AI search for clips is a powerful way to find the perfect clips for your next project. It works on not just the content in each scene, but also on the contextual understanding of the scene in relation to the overall content.
