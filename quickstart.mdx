## Before you begin
Tessact is currently invite-only. You can request a demo from the [contact page](https://tessact.ai/contact).

- **Invitation email** — You must receive a Tessact invite from our team before you can sign up.
- **Your assets** — You can upload any media file to Tessact. However for best performance, we recommend H.264/AAC `.mp4` under 12 Mb/s. For more information see [supported media formats](media-formats).

<Warning>
  The invitation link on the email expires after 24 hours for added security. If it lapses, use Login with OTP on the [login](https://app.tessact.ai/login) page instead.
</Warning>

## 3. Upload your first asset

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select files">
    Click **Upload** or drag your media into the Library.

    <Tip>
      For the fastest turnaround, follow the media formats and codecs guide.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for ingest to finish">
    Tessact uploads and queues the file for AI analysis. A progress bar appears on the asset card.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Average analysis speed is **≈ 15 minutes per hour of H.264/AAC content under
  10 Mb/s**. Non-preferred codecs or higher bitrates trigger transcoding and
  extend processing time.
