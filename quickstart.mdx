## Before you begin

Before you get started, make sure you have:

- **An Invitation email** — You must receive a Tessact invite from our team before you can sign up.
  <Card arrow="true" horizontal href="https://tessact.ai/contact">
    Request an invite from our team
  </Card><br/>
- **Your assets** — You can upload any media file to Tessact. However for best performance, we recommend H.264/AAC `.mp4` under 12 Mb/s. For more information see [supported media formats](media-formats).

<Warning>
  The invitation link on the email expires after 24 hours for added security. If
  it lapses, use Login with OTP on the [login](https://app.tessact.ai/login)
  page instead.
</Warning>

## 3. Upload your first asset

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select files">
    Click **Upload** on the top right of the screen or drag your media into the Library.

      ![Asset upload progress](/images/uploading.jpg)
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for analysing to finish">
    Tessact uploads and queues the file for AI analysis. A progress pill appears on the asset card showing the progress of the analysis.

    <Note>
      Average analysis speed is **≈ 15 minutes per hour of H.264/AAC content under
      10 Mb/s**. [Non-preferred codecs](/media-formats) or higher bitrates trigger
      transcoding and extend processing time.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Trigger AI actions

Once your asset is analysed, you can trigger AI actions on it.

<Tip>
  You can upload as many files as you want to the Library and trigger AI actions
  on them all.
</Tip>

### Remix (create social clips)

Once analysing is finished, you can see the Remix bar at the bottom of the screen. Hovering on the suggestions will show you more suggestions for clips you can create with AI, or allow you to write your own prompt.
